GAN architecture options:
Vanilla? One generator one discriminator.
Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks? multiple discriminator receiving varying real images to compare with the fake.
BEGAN? encoder decoder architecture
BiGAN? - to create good embeddings representation.

TODOS:
create a transformer from generated to real? can we achieve that?
